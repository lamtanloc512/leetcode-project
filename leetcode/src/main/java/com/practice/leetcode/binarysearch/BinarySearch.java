/**
 * Problem: Binary Search
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an
 * integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists,
 * then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
 *
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * - -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
 * - All the integers in nums are unique.
 * - nums is sorted in ascending order.
