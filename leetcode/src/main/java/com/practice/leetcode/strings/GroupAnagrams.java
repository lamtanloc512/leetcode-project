/**
 * Problem: Group Anagrams
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return
 * the answer in any order.
 * 
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
 * different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
 * once.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
 * Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
 *
 * Input: strs = [""]
 * Output: [[""]]
 *
 * Input: strs = ["a"]
 * Output: [["a"]]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
 * - 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * - strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
