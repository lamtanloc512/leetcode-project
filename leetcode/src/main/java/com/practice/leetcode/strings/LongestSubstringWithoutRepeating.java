/**
 * Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without
 * repeating characters.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 *
 * Input: s = "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 *
 * Input: s = "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and
 * not a substring.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * - s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
