/**
 * Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its
 * nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
 *
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: [[1]]
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
 * - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
