/**
 * Problem: Invert Binary Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
 * Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
 *
 * Input: root = [2,1,3]
 * Output: [2,3,1]
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
 * - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
