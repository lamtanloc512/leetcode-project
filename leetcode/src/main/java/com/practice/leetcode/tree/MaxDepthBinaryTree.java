/**
 * Problem: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
 * 
 * A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path
 * from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Input: root = [1,null,2]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
