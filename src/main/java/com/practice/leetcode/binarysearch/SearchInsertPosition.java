/**
 * Problem: Search Insert Position
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the
 * index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be
 * if it were inserted in order.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
 * Output: 4
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * - nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
 * - -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
