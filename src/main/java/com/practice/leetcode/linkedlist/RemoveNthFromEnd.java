/**
 * Problem: Remove Nth Node From End of List
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the
 * list and return its head.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
 * Output: [1,2,3,5]
 *
 * Input: head = [1], n = 1
 * Output: []
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
 * Output: [1]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the list is sz.
 * - 1 <= sz <= 30
 * - 0 <= Node.val <= 100
 * - 1 <= n <= sz
 *
 * Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
