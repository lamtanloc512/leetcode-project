/**
 * Problem: Same Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if
 * they are the same or not.
 * 
 * Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical,
 * and the nodes have the same value.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
 * Output: true
 *
 * Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
 * Output: false
 *
 * Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
 * Output: false
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
 * - -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
