/**
 * Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
 *
 * Description:
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
 * on the ith day.
 * 
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
 * and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 * 
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you
 * cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),
 * profit = 6-1 = 5.
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
 * - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
