/**
 * Problem: Last Stone Weight
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/
 *
 * Description:
 * You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of
 * the ith stone.
 * 
 * We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest
 * two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have
 * weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
 * - If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
 * - If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y
 * has new weight y - x.
 * 
 * At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
 * 
 * Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left,
 * return 0.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the
 * value of the last stone.
 *
 * Input: stones = [1]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= stones.length <= 30
 * - 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
