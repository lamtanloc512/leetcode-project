/**
 * Problem: Number of Islands
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land)
 * and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
 * 
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
 * horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are
 * all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: grid = [
 * ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Input: grid = [
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 * ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 * ]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - m == grid.length
 * - n == grid[i].length
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * - grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
